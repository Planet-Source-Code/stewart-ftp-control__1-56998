### Description

This is an FTP OCX control. What it does is provide easy to use FTP access to applications. Applications can choose weather to download the file to a location using this control or to strictly store it in a string and make it accessible to the application. This way you could use it to say download a text file from an FTP site in your text editor. I know this control will work in vb6, and I'm almost positive it will also work in VB 4 and 5 because it just uses API to achieve it's goal. Leave comments and suggestions. Thanks :)
